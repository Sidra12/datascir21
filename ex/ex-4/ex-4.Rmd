The goal of this exercise is to make yourself familiar with R Markdown documents.

## Working with R Markdown in RStudio

- Click on the **Knit** button to render a HTML file. Locate the folder of 
the HTML file in the "Files" tab of RStudio. 
Try to knit the rmd file with the Keyboard shortcut **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**K**.
- Click on the small downwards arrow right to the **Knit** button and render the document as Word and PDF output, respectively.
- Click on the gear wheel icon right to the **Knit** button to explore various settings and format options.

What happens when you click on the green arrow at the right of the code chunk with the label "pressure" below? 
(You can accomplish the same by moving the cursor into the code chunk and then pressing **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**Enter**.) 
(-> [**Notebook mode**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html))

## Understanding Markdown syntax

In this document, locate the words/parts of a sentence that are written 

- in bold face,
- in italics,
- as headers of level 2,
- as inline code.

Consult the _Markdown Quick Reference_ in RStudio and add the following image of the Magdeburg cathedral using Markdown syntax: <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Magdeburg%2C_domtsjerke.jpg/512px-Magdeburg%2C_domtsjerke.jpg>.

## Important Knitr chunk options

Consider the code chunk `boxplot-iris-species`. 
Knit the document once with each combination of the chunk options `echo` and `eval` to understand their impact on the output in the rendered document.

```{r boxplot-iris-species, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
ggplot2::ggplot(iris, ggplot2::aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot()
```

Inspect the output of the following code chunk `faithful`.

```{r faithful}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot() + 
  geom_contour_filled(
    data = faithfuld, 
    aes(eruptions, waiting, z = density), 
    bins = 10
  ) + 
  geom_point(
    data = faithful, 
    aes(eruptions, waiting), 
    color = "white", alpha = 0.75
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

- Find a way to get rid of the console `message` when the `tidyverse` package is loaded. 
- Run the "faithful" code chunk separately in Notebook mode. How can you interact with the output?
- Change the figure width to 30 cm. Rerender the document and inspect the result.

## The setup chunk

Understand the purpose of the _setup_ code chunk by performing the following actions:

- Restart the session. Remove the line `library(tidyverse)` from the code chunk `faithful`. 
Add the line `library(ggplot2)` in setup chunk. 
Try to run the `faithful` code chunk directly  without running the previous code chunks. Does it still work?
- Restart the session. 
Cut `library(ggplot2)` from the setup chunk and place it into a new unnamed chunk (shortcut **Ctrl+Alt+I**) beneath the `faithful` chunk. 
Try to run the `faithful` code chunk.
Does it (still) work?
- Restart the session. 
Place the unnamed code chunk right above the `faithful` chunk. 
Try to run the `faithful` code chunk. 
Does it (still) work?

## Caching

The following code chunk `heavy-computing` runs time-consuming code.

```{r heavy-computing, eval = FALSE}
tic <- Sys.time() # Current system time (before doing heavy computation)
mean(1:1000000000) # admittedly pointless command :#)
toc <- Sys.time() # Current system time (after doing heavy computation)
time_spent <- difftime(toc, tic, units = "secs") # computation time in secs
```

Below the chunk, add an _inline_ code chunk that prints `time_spent`.

1. Set `eval = TRUE` in the code chunk `heavy-computing`.
1. Knit the document. What is the value of `time_spent`?
1. Knit the document again. What is the value of `time_spent`?
1. Add result caching as code chunk option to `heavy-computing`. 
Knit the document again. What is the value of `time_spent`?
1. Knit the document again. What is the value of `time_spent`?

## YAML header

- In the YAML header, add the fields "author" and "date". Set the values so 
that in the rendered output document, your name and the current date (`Sys.date()`) 
will be shown.
- Change the document visual theme of the HTML document. 
To do so, inspect the documentation of `?html_document` to find out which themes can be chosen. 
Go to <https://bootswatch.com/> to see a preview of the available themes and pick 
the theme you like most. 

## References and bibliography

_Make the citations in the following text fragment work! _

Lorem [@latexcompanion] ipsum [@knuthwebsite] dolor sit amet [@einstein].

- Uncomment the following bibtex snippets (**Ctrl**+**Shift**+**C**) and copy them into a new text file `refs.bib` placed in the same folder as this R Markdown document.
- Add to the YAML header: `bibliography: refs.bib`.
- Knit the document. The bibliography is automatically inserted at the end of the document.
- Optionally, you can modify the citation style. For example, you can search for styles on <https://www.zotero.org/styles> and download the corresponding `.csl` files. After placing the file into the folder of the R Markdown document, you add in the YAML header: `csl: <NAME>.csl`

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
