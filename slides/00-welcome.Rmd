## Who are <u>YOU</u>?

.pull-left60[

- You are studying either **DKE** or another Master FIN degree with focus on data science.
- You have heard one or more **introductory data science courses** in the previous semesters.
  - "Data Mining I" by Prof. Spiliopoulou
  - "Machine Learning" by Prof. NÃ¼rnberger
  - "Visual Analytics" by Prof. Preim
  - ...
- While you liked these courses to learn fundamental data science concepts, you 
have not had the chance to apply this theoretical knowledge in a **practical 
project on real-world datasets**.
- You are most proficient in **Python** (or **Java**).
- You have no or very **little experience with R**, but are keen to learn it either 
because you either heard of R's reputation to be a powerful language for 
data science projects or simply to complete your programming skill set.

```

???

- at the end of the semester, you should be confidently able to use R to gain insights from data 
- workflow of a typical DS project
- import data from a file, database, website or web API and load as data frame into R
- transform and clean
  - bring it into a form that is consistent with the semantics of the data
  - transform: feature engineering: derive new variables or do some feature selection or reduction (required most of the time)
- visualization: shows things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data
  - hints that you are asking the wrong question or need to collect different data
- models: classification, regression
- communication: crucial to communicate to others
- DS often involves a lot of trial and error
  - don't know the best approach in advance
- often starts with some initial questions
  - initial questions are often quite vague, because you are working on an unsolved problem
  - improve quality of the questions after EDA (better data understanding) or first modeling results

Part 1: until first week of June

- asynchronous content: slides, videos, exercises, and quizzes
- synchronous elements: weekly meetings (code-along, questions)

Part 2: throughout the entire semester

```

???

first part: in each week we cover a different topic 
- videos
- slides
- exercises
- quizzes
- additional reading

- crash course is not meant to be exhaustive
- "common ground" like packages that all of you are most likely going to use in your projects 
- however, you are encouraged to use also other packages

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to proficiently perform the following tasks in `R`:

- **import and preprocess raw data**
- **transform data** for modelling
- perform **exploratory data analysis** with **summary statistics** and **visualization**
- understand, build and evaluate predictive **classification and prediction models**, including **regression** models, **tree-based** models, **ensembles** and **boosted** models
- communicate and disseminate results and findings through **reproducible documents**, presentations, websites and **interactive web applications**

## Quizzes

- Handled on E-Learning (Moodle)
- 7 quizzes in total with 5 questions each
- Each quiz open on Mondays 00:00 and is due on the following Sunday at 23:59 Germany time
  - The first quiz is available between 12.04 00:00 and 18.04 23:59
- Work on them individually
- Lowest score is dropped, i.e., only your 6 best results count
- Total score of correctly answered questions gives you up to 30 pt for your final grade
- Questions must be answered in a fixed order, which means you **cannot** return to previous questions

## Project

In a nutshell: **_Find an interesting dataset and do something with it!_**

- analyze a dataset of your choice
- demonstrate your proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this course (+ desirably beyond)
- **quality over quantity**: don't compute every possible statistic, but :
    - show that you can **ask meaningful questions and answer them using R**
    - display that you are **skilled at interpreting and presenting your results**
    - critically scrutinize your approach (**adequacy**) and your results (**reliability, validity**) and make suggestions for improving your analysis
- emphasize on **compelling visualizations** and a **convincing, coherent and clear narrative**
- all analyses must be done in R; you are encouraged to use tidyverse packages but you don't have to  

---

## The project data

- choose any dataset which is _not analyzed to death_ (no Kaggle, UCI ML repo, or similar)
- the dataset may already exist or you may collect your own data via a survey or an experiment
- the dataset may be based on your personal interests or based previous projects in other courses

## Zoom meetings

We will have weekly Zoom meetings. They are completely optional.

The Zoom meetings are mainly for:

* code-alongs
* Q&A

--

Expectations for Zoom meetings:

In larger sessions you should

- have your microphone muted by default
- use the _raise hand_ feature or type questions and comments in the chat

In small team sessions you should 

- have your camera turned on as much as possible
- engage with your team mates via voice and text chat
- take turns sharing your screens when necessary

---

## Collaboration regulations

- Only work in the context of the team project should be completed collaboratively.
- Exercises should be completed individually.
- Quizzes must be completed individually.
- You are welcome to discuss problems in general and ask for advice.

---

## Sharing and reusing code policy

- You can use any online resources, but you must explicitly state where you got the code that you use directly or use as inspiration for your solutions.
- Any reused code that is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of the source.

---

## Late work policy

- Submissions after the deadline will not be considered.
- General advice: Don't wait until the last minute.
- But: Email me if there are reasons beyond your control that prevent timely submission.
